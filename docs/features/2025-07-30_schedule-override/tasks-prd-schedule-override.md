## Relevant Files

- `src/schedule/schedule.overrides.ts` - Main file with implemented override logic
- `src/schedule/schedule.overrides.test.ts` - Unit tests for override functionality (updated for new interface)
- `src/schedule/schedule.generation.ts` - Modified to support partial date range regeneration via `regenerateScheduleForDateRange`
- `src/notion/notion.sync.service.ts` - Added `syncDateRangeToNotion` method for targeted Notion synchronization
- `src/database/queries.ts` - Contains `upsertOverrides` function and new `findEngineersBeingReplaced` function
- `src/schedule/schedule.notifications.ts` - Contains notification logic that can be leveraged
- `src/utils/date.ts` - Date utilities including new `getWeekdaysInRange` function
- `src/utils/validation.ts` - Validation logic for override requests
- `src/utils/validation.test.ts` - Unit tests for validation utilities

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Implement validation utilities for override requests
  - [x] 1.1 Create `src/utils/validation.ts` with validation helper functions
  - [x] 1.2 Implement `validateEngineerForRotation(email: string, rotation: OncallRotationName)` to check if engineer exists and is qualified for the rotation
  - [x] 1.3 Implement `validateDateRange(startDate: string, endDate: string)` to ensure dates are valid and not in the past
  - [x] 1.4 Write unit tests for all validation functions in `src/utils/validation.test.ts`

- [x] 2.0 Implement the core override schedule function
  - [x] 2.1 Update `overrideSchedule` function in `src/schedule/schedule.overrides.ts` to remove the "Not implemented" error
  - [x] 2.2 Add input validation using the validation utilities from task 1.0
  - [x] 2.3 Implement date range expansion to create individual date entries between start_date and end_date (excluding weekends)
  - [x] 2.4 Call `upsertOverrides` to persist override records to the database
  - [x] 2.5 Find affected engineers who are being replaced for notification purposes
  - [x] 2.6 Return appropriate success/error response structure

- [x] 3.0 Modify schedule generation to support partial date ranges
  - [x] 3.1 Create a new function `regenerateScheduleForDateRange(startDate: string, endDate: string)` in schedule.generation.ts
  - [x] 3.2 Modify the function to only regenerate schedule entries for the specified date range
  - [x] 3.3 Ensure the regeneration respects existing overrides in the database
  - [x] 3.4 Integrate Notion sync for only the affected dates
  - [x] 3.5 Call this function from `overrideSchedule` after persisting overrides

- [x] 4.0 Implement notification system for affected engineers
  - [x] 4.1 Create `notifyOverrideAssignment` function in `src/schedule/schedule.notifications.ts`
  - [x] 4.2 Implement logic to notify the engineer being assigned to the override
  - [x] 4.3 Implement logic to notify the engineer being replaced (if applicable)
  - [x] 4.4 Handle notification failures gracefully without blocking the override process
  - [x] 4.5 Add appropriate logging for notification events

- [x] 5.0 Add comprehensive error handling and testing
  - [x] 5.1 Add try-catch blocks with specific error types in `overrideSchedule`
  - [x] 5.2 Create comprehensive unit tests for `overrideSchedule` function
  - [x] 5.3 Add integration tests to verify end-to-end override flow
  - [x] 5.4 Test edge cases: overlapping dates, invalid engineers, past dates, weekend handling
  - [x] 5.5 Verify Lambda response format matches expected structure for both success and error cases
